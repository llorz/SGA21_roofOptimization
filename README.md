In this project, we propose a novel and flexible roof modeling approach that can be used for constructing planar 3D polygon roof meshes. 
Our method uses a *graph* structure to encode roof topology and enforces the roof validity by optimizing a simple *planarity metric* we propose.
We showcase two applications: (1) an interactive roof editing framework that can be used for roof design or roof reconstruction from aerial images.
(2) a generative model to synthesize new roof meshes from scratch.
